  * Require the md5sum suffix on uri targets, this means we don't have to
    download them when we already have a file with the correct checksum.
    Before the checksum was optional, but human nature being what it is
    many targets were left without checksums resulting in unnecessary
    file downloads on every run of the autobuilder.  It also resulted in
    builds failing when corrupt downloads occurred.

  * When a build dependency regresses and the --allow-build-dependency-regressions
    flag is used, we need to rebuild packages that experience such regressions.  It
    is not correct that they don't need rebuilding because they were built with even
    newer packages than the ones available.  Frequently they have binary dependencies
    on packages that are no longer available.
  * Fix a bug in the build dependency computations which caused unnecessary rebuilds.

  * Store the dependency info and the relaxed dependency info with the target.

  * Record the version number from the source code changelog in the
    "Revision:" string, which is added to the .dsc file.  This can then be
    compared to the version number found in the changelog of the current
    source code when making the build decision.  This will cause some
    packages built with the old autobuilder to rebuild unnecessarily, but
    only in the case where there is a vendor tag in the current source
    code.  This makes some code in VersionPolicy obsolete.
  * Use $! to try to avoid some "file is locked" errors.  This needs to be

autobuilder (2.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pull in a build-env fix
  * Changes in configuration parameters relating to the upload repository.
    The retired parameters are:
  	Remote-URI	Replaced by Upload-URI
  	Release		Replaced by Build-Release
    The new parameters are:
  	Base-Release	The basis release which our release will augment
  	Upload-URI	An URI we can use to dupload to
  	Build-URI	The download-only equivalent of Upload-URI
  	Build-Release	The name of the release we are building into
  * Create the remote repository if necessary when using --do-upload
  * Construct from the Upload-URI at the beginning of each run, in case
    new releases and sections are added.  This avoids having to manually
    create the empty indexes.
  * Don't require configuration files to start with a digit, just that
    they don't start with a dot and don't end with a tilde.  The idea is
    that their order shouldn't be important, though I'm not sure how this
    affects the behavior of several conflicting Let directives.
  * Don't include the top section of the configuration file as a global
    section.  Just use the ones mentioned on the command line.
  * Implement the verbosity flag in newdist.
  * Don't remove and rebuild environments whenever their sources.list
    changes, allow apt-get update to repair them.
  * Add a required Component parameter to specify what component packages
    should be uploaded to.  Packages will be moved into the same component
    of the remote repository that they are in locally.
  * Build directories need to be in format <sourcepackage>-<upstreamversion>
    no epoch or release.
  * Honor the section names listed in the .changes file.
  * Add a function to set up the ssh keys to contact the upload host.

  * Overhaul the progress reporting.
  * Eliminate the Strip-Vendor-Tag option.  It is dangerous to strip tags
    off of version numbers because after that we might be unable to add a

  * The DebSource datatype now contains a Repository rather than a URI.
    This is because the URI in that record actually represents the root
    directory of a repository, so we want to verify that the URI actually 
    points to a valid, accessable repository before creating a DebSource.
  * Added a map from URI -> Repository to the state portion of the ABIO
