  the vendor name to use when constructing the version numbers, the host names
  of repository mirrors, and anything else site specific or likely to change.

Comment:
  The four Let values above need to be adjusted for the repository you
  will be uploading to.  If you are only building packages and don't
  plan to upload them to a repository, you only need to set
  upload-host and upload-repo.  These are required to ensure that
  packages build do not conflict with packages already in the
  repository you are building against.
